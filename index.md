Prior to this position, she worked as a postdoctoral researcher in the [*Sound Forest Lab*](https://www.soundforestlab.org/) at the *Sustainability and the Global Environment Research Center (SAGE), University of Wisconsin-Madison* with *Dr Zuzana Burivalova*. In this role, she investigated how we can use time-series and other statistical approaches to assess how disturbances such as logging and hunting impact soundscapes in Gabon.  

Her PhD research focused on how bats respond to land-use change across Borneo, using machine learning to automate bat monitoring in this region. This research was funded by the [Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) EnvEast Doctoral Training Partnership](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/career-and-skills-development/nerc-studentships/responsive-training/nerc-doctoral-training-partnerships-dtp/doctoral-training-partnerships-1/) under the supervision of *Dr Matthew Struebig* and *Dr Jake Bicknell*, as part of the *Leverhulme Tropical Defaunation Hub, Durrell Institute of Conservation & Ecology (DICE), University of Kent*. 

Prior to joining DICE, she undertook her Masters in Environmental Management at the University of Salford investigating the impacts of habitat fragmentation on bats in the Amazon. During her studies, she has collaborated on projects investigating the effects of land-use change in Central & South America, Asia, and Northern and Western Europe.
