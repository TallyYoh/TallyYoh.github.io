Her work focuses on improving acoustic monitoring methods for tropical species, and using this approach to monitor responses to land-use change. For her thesis, she has focused on bat responses to palm oil and logging across Borneo and using machine learning to automate bat monitoring in this region. This research is funded by the [NERC EnvEast DTP](https://www.ukri.org/councils/nerc/career-and-skills-development/nerc-studentships/responsive-training/nerc-doctoral-training-partnerships-dtp/doctoral-training-partnerships-1/) under the supervision of Dr Matthew Struebig and Dr Jake Bicknell, as part of the Leverhulme Tropical Defaunation Hub.

Prior to joining DICE, she undertook her Masters in Environmental Management at the University of Salford investigating the impacts of habitat fragmentation on bats in the Amazon. During her studies she has collaborated on projects investigating the effects of land-use change in Central & South America, Asia, and Western Europe. 


She is part of the editorial board for the [Journal of Bat Research & Conservation](https://secemu.org/en/journal-of-bat-research-and-conservation/overview/#:~:text=The%20Journal%20of%20Bat%20Research,possible%20perspectives%20and%20author%20interests.) and is a keen member of the Women in Conservation Canterbury Network. She also works as a part-time research consultant focusing on diversity in academia.
